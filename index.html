        <h1> Hi! I'm Arij</h1>
        <p> I am a third year computer science student at University Of Illnois Chicago. I am interested in Data Engineering,
             Computer Graphis, Software Engineering, and Programming in different languages.
             My hopes are that I will graduate in December of 2023 with my degree in Computer Science. </p>
        <p> However this home page is so you can get to know who I am besides a student.</p>

        <p>  Reading is a good and important hobby for me since it helps you escape from your everyday routine while also improving your imagination. When you read a good book, you can become completely absorbed in the plot. 
             A book allows you to leave your everyday routine and immerse yourself into a new universe! 
             Being technically minded, I enjoy reading science fiction which allows me to exercise the creative parts of my thought processes, which in turn develops my problem solving skills.  
             One of my favorite reads are; The Time Machine by H.G Wells, Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, and The Martian by Andy Weir.
             <p> Here is picture of my hunger games book collection </p>

            <p> After a long day, I relax by playing video games. It's only fair that I bring it up because growing up playing video games was a big part of my day and also
                one of the main reasons I got into programming. 
                The ability to play with your friends and escape reality for a few hours has allowed me to mentally prepare for each day. </p>
            <p> Apex Legends is currently one of my favorite games. It's a multiplayer battle royale game that emphasizes strategy, collaboration, and communication. 
                It's given me the opportunity to work on my communication and teamwork skills while doing something I enjoy. </p>
            <p> On that note here is one of my favorite clips of mine of the game and if you checked it out maybe you might 
                like it and play it yourself, as it's a free game that you can download on either PC or Console.

            <h3> Sports</h3>

            <p> Although I am not an athlete, I prefer to be physically active by participating in sports. I enjoy playing basketball because I consider it to be an art form. 
                It's a multi-faceted sport that has taught me a lot both on and off the court. Spending so much time playing basketball has given me a lot of advantages as a team player. 
                It has also taught me how to find elegance in the middle of chaos, similar to how an NBA player must select when to dribble, pass, or shoot. </p>
            <p> In my house a lot of sports are watched like the NBA, NFL, some soccer, and my favorite MMA. Watching MMA is possibly 
                the best sport to watch with your family and friends, as its so unprecidetable and I believe that its the puerest form of comeptition.  
                I have two favorite teams that are the Bears and Bulls. GO BEARS AND GO BULLS!</p>
            <p> I also workout 5-6 times a week which helps with my mental health. Working out puts me in a better mood, helps me concentrate and stay focused,
                and overall improves my physical health. When I hit 215 on bench, I will make sure to add a video of that on this website. :)

                <h3> Cooking</h3>
                <img class="basketball" src= "/Users/user/Documents/GitHub/Personal-Website/cooking.jpeg"
                alt="Cooking Image" />
                <p>I started to gain an interet for cooking as I started to workout out more. I knew that in order for me to get bigger and stronger, I needed to eat right. 
                I think the hardest part about staying fit is the eating part compared to the working out part. If you have a good diet and workout consistenly then you will reach your goal easily. 
                I won't say I can cook like Gordan Ramsey, but I think I can cook some decent meals that my family or friends will enjoy. I usually will cook a dish with some type of protein like chicken, fish, salmon, beef, and etc. 
                On the side I'll have some sort of carbohydrate like baked sweet potatoes (my favorite) and then some vegtables as well. But the main reason I started to love cooking is because it keeps me stress free. 
                For example when I am cooking I have very little time to think, because the cooking is challenging my mind and taking my mind off the stress of everyday life. </p>

        <div class="Volunteering">
            <h3> Volunteering </h3>
           
            <p>On Fridays and throughout the month of Ramadan, I volunteer at my local mosque, which is my favorite hobby. Friday is a significant day in Islam, and the community meets at the mosque at noon to pray. 
             I arrive early to assist with tasks such as organizing the parking lot, assisting the elderly, and directing people. 
             I am grateful for the opportunity to do so because I enjoy getting to know the community better and helping the community itself get closer.  
             Being a positive influence in your community is a first step toward positively affecting the rest of the world. I'm hoping to get there one day.</p>
